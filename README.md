# C-Math-Parser

This project was a homework for Yıldız Technical University.

This project parses mathematical expressions from strings and uses them to run classic numerical methods including root-finding (Bisection, Regula-Falsi, Newton-Raphson), numerical differentiation, numerical integration (Trapezoidal, Simpson’s 1/3 and 3/8), interpolation, and solving linear systems.

It can parse expressions such as: 

* 3x^2*sin(x)-log_2(x+1)
* cos(x)^2+2*(4*x-e^(x/2))
* x^3-5*x+1
